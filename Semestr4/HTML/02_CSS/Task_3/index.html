        <h3>Mathematical formulas</h3>
        <div>
            <h5>Linear Equations</h5>
            <p>
                A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
            </p>
            <section class="c_math"> ax + b = 0 </section>
            <p>where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a
                linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may
                or may not be an x so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <em>x</em> there.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h5>Quadratic Equation</h5>
            <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
            <section class="c_math">ax <sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 </section>
            <p>where <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> are known values and <em>x</em> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <em>a</em> can't be
                0.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h5>The area of a circle (A)</h5>
            <p><em>&#960;</em> (Pi) times the radius (<em>r</em>) squared:</p>
            <section class="c_math">A = &#960; &#215; r<sup>2</sup></section>
            <p>or, when you know the diameter (<em>D</em>):</p>
            <section class="c_math">A = (&#960; / 4) &#215; D<sup>2</sup></section>
            <p>or, when you know the circumference (<em>C</em>):</p>
            <section class="c_math">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &#215; &#960;</section>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h5>Intersection</h5>
            <p>The intersection of two sets <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, denoted by A &#x2229; B, is the set of all objects that are members
                of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
            <section class="c_math">A &#x2229; B = { x : x &#x2208; A and x &#x2208; B }</section>
            <p>That is, x is an element of the intersection A &#x2229; B if and only if <em>x</em> is both an element of <em>A</em> and an
                element of <em>B</em>.</p>
